## Source

The data within this application are collected by each grantee in a format compliant with the *HMIS Data Standards*. This data originates from one of a few separate HMIS databases in the State. The HMIS databases have the capability to query the database and export a .zip file. This .zip file can be uploaded into the **COHHIO Youth Data Dashboard** app via the app's "*Upload*" page.

## Architecture

The following architecture diagram shows how the app can be used for both uploading (.zip file) HMIS data, and visualizing previously uploaded HMIS data.

## Data Dictionary

The data dictionary for each element across each file can be found [here](https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-Data-Dictionary-2024.pdf). This data dictionary was used to develop the package datasets, which are created in [data-raw](https://github.com/COHHIO/ryha/tree/master/data-raw) and stored in [data](https://github.com/COHHIO/ryha/tree/master/data).
